All the courses have been encrypted using git-crypt.
If you want to be able to work on the decrypted file make sure that you have git-crypt installed locally.
Ask the repo owner for the encryption key.
Then decrypt the repo files using the command:
```bash
git-crypt unlock /path/to/git-crypt-key
```
Great, you should now be able to work with the course files.
